</code></pre><h2 id=formal-logic>Formal Logic<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#formal-logic>#</a></h2><p>Here comes the formal-logic based proof of our algorithm&rsquo;s correctness. Kindly, note that it might still be flawed. However, If it is not, Then we guarantee the algorithm to yield the correct answer without any bugs or errors. Anyway, Before getting into the proof, We need to rigoursly model the problem of <em>Laser Sculpture - 11683</em>. Those rigor definitions and constraints are derived from our understanding of the problem.</p><h3 id=definitions>Definitions<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#definitions>#</a></h3><p>For the following, We assume $h$, $w$ $\in \mathcal{N}$</p><p><strong>Board</strong>: A 2d-array-alike corresponding to overall units. board is $b = (h \times w)$, units $u_{i,j}$ indexed (labeled) by a cartesian product of board&rsquo;s height and width.</p><p>$X_0$: We define an imaginary height equal to $h$ of a given board. It serves on behalf the left most outer border for the first iteration of our algorithm.</p><p><strong>Sculpture set on board</strong>: A family of sets where each set is the set of units sculpted by the laser while it is still on. The sculpture set is $S = ${$ S_1, S_2, .., S_k$} such that $\cup S \subseteq b$, $S_i \cap S_j = \phi$ for any distinct i and j, $S_i \neq \phi$ for any i. That says sculptures are subset of the original board units, no two sculptures are intersecting, and there&rsquo;s no empty sculpture. That conforms with our understanding that a unit cannot be shot twice by a laser, and a laser is not going to be turned on without sculpting some unit.</p><p><strong>Top-first</strong>: That is a condition which ensures no sculpture occurs on some layer before the layer above it is sculptured. For any $S_q \in S$, $\forall u_{i,j} \in S_q( ${$ u_{x,j} \in b | x < i $}$ \subseteq S_{q-1} \cup S_{q-2} \cup .. \cup S_{1} )$.</p><p><strong>One-row</strong>: That is a condition which ensures a continuous row of units are sculptured at once, not sculptured on multiple times in which the laser is turned on and off multiple times as well. For any two distinct $S_k$ and $S_q$, $\neg( \exists j_0 \exists j_1, u_{i_0,j_0} \in S_q \wedge u_{i_1,j_1} \in S_k \wedge j_1=j_0+1)$ for some $u_{i_0,j_0}$ and $u_{i_1,j_1}$.</p><p><strong>Uniqueness</strong>: It is assumed that there is a unique number of times for the laser to be toggled on and off regardless of of the <em>sculpture set</em>. In other words, Even if there are two possible different sculptures which achieve the desired X&rsquo;s, The number of times the laser needs to be toggled on and off is the same.</p><p><strong>Existince of a Solution</strong>: It is assumed that given height $h$, and width $w$ of the whole board $b$, and given heights $X_1$, $X_2$, .., $X_w$ of position $i$ in the board, There exists a <em>sculpture set</em> $S$ <em>on board</em> $b$ such that $b - S = \cup_{p \in 1, 2, .., w }$ {$ u_{i,p} \in b $} whereby each set {$ u_{i,p_0} \in b $} has a cardinality of $X_{p_0}$. In other words, The set yielded from subtracting the board from sculpture set is composed of units conforming to desired $X$&rsquo;s heights.</p><p><strong>Principal Problem Statement</strong> (finally): Given a board $b_{h \times w}$ of height $h$ and width $w \in \mathcal{Z}^+$, and given heights $X_1$, $X_2$, .., $X_w$, The cardinality of $\textit{sculpture set on board}$ $b$ is equal to $\Sigma_{i=0}^{w-1}min(0, X_i-X_{i+1})$</p><h3 id=proof>Proof<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#proof>#</a></h3><p><strong>Lemma</strong>: For $b-S$, where $b$ is a board of height $h$ and width $w \geq 2$ and $S$ is a <em>sculpture set on</em> $b$ conforming to given heights of unsculpted units of last two board columns $X_{w-1}$ and $X_w$,</p><p><strong>(1)</strong> if $X_{w} < i \leq X_{w-1}$, a unit $u_{i, w}$ is contained in some $S_k$ and no other unit is in $S_k$. That is, for some $S_k \in S$, $S_k = ${$ u_{i, w} $}.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong> if $X_{w} \leq X_{w-1} < i$, a unit $u_{i, w}$ is contained in some $S_k$ which is per se contains an element of $\textit{board}$ $b^{'} = b_{h \times w-1}$.</p><p><strong>(1) Solution</strong>: Assume $X_{w} < i \leq X_{w-1}$. Clearly, unit $u_{i, w} \in \cup S$, As it is above height of column $X_w$. So, $u_{i, w} \in S_k$ for some $S_k \in S$. $S_k$ does not contain other units which are above, below, or diagonal to $u_{i, w}$. Otherwise, $\textit{top first}$ or $\textit{one row}$ conditions shall be violated. Also, no other units are left to $u_{i, w}$ in $S_k$, As $i \leq X_{w-1}$. Hence, $S_k = ${$ u_{i, w} $}.</p><p><strong>(2) Solution</strong>: Assume $X_{w} \leq X_{w-1} < i$. Similar to $\textbf{(1) solution}$, unit $u_{i, w} \in \cup S$, As it is above height of column $X_w$. So, $u_{i, w} \in S_k$ for some $S_k \in S$. $S_k$ does not contain other units which are above, below, or diagonal to $u_{i, w}$. Otherwise, $\textit{top first}$ or $\textit{one row}$ conditions shall be violated. However, unlike $\textbf{(1) solution}$, Nothing precludes a unit left to $u_{i, w}$ to be contained in $S_k$, As $X_{w-1} < i$. On the contrary, if $S_k = ${$ u_{i, w} $} then $\textit{one row}$ condition shall be violated as two sculptures are going to be on the same row without any non-blank separator between them. Through $\textit{proof by contradiction}$, $S_k \neq ${$ u_{i, w} $}. Hence, there are some units $u \in S_k$. Since units from all directions are excluded, except only the left direction, $u_{i, w-1} \in S_k$, which is clearly a unit of $\textit{board}$ $b^{'} = b_{h \times w-1}$.</p><p><strong>Corollary</strong>: From <strong>Lemma (1)</strong>, Obviously, $S_k$ is not an element of $\textit{sculpture set on board}$ $b^{'} = b_{h \times w-1}$ due to the fact that $S_k \not\subseteq b^{'}$</p><p><strong>Problem Statement</strong> (main proof): First we re-write the statement defined above in a more convenient form for induction proof.</p><p>for $w \in \mathcal{Z}^+$,<br>Given $h \in \mathcal{N}$, and heights $X_1$, $X_2$, .., $X_w$, sculpture set on board $b_{h \times w}$ has a cardinality of $\Sigma_{i=0}^{w-1}min(0, X_i-X_{i+1})$.</p><p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br>base, for $w = 1$,<br>Assume we are given $h \in \mathcal{N}$, and heights $X_1$, $X_2$, .., $X_w$. A board $b_{h \times w}$ has a sculpture set on it, by assumption.
Assume $X_{1} < i$. By definition $X_0 = h$. So, $X_1 < i < X_0$. via $\textbf{Lemma (1)}$, each unit $u_{i, 1}$ is contained in some $S_k$ and no other unit is in $S_k$. In other words, cardinality of {$ u_{i, 1} | X_1 < i $} is equal to $S$, the sculpture set on board $b$. clearly, it is also equal to ($X_0$ - $X_1$). since $X_0 \geq X_1$, ($X_0$ - $X_1$) = min(0, $X_0$ - $X_1$) which justifies our problem statement.</p><p>induction hypothesis, for $w^{'} \in \mathcal{Z}^+$ we assume problem statement&rsquo;s validity.</p><p>induction step, for $w = w^{'}+1$,<br>Assume we are given $h \in \mathcal{N}$, and heights $X_1$, $X_2$, .., $X_w$. A board $b_{h \times w}$ has a sculpture set on it, by assumption.
Assume $X_{w} < i$.<br>$\textbf{case 1}$: if it is the case the $i \leq X_{w-1}$, then similarly to base case, each unit $u_{i, w}$ counts a new element in $S$, the sculpture set on board $b$. Recall from $\textbf{corollary}$ that those are not in $S^{'}$, sculpture set on board $b^{'}_{h \times w-1}$. cardinality of units $u_{i, w}$ are clearly equal to $X_{w-1} - X_{w}$. Also, It is clear that $X_{w-1} > X_{w}$, Hence, $X_{w-1} - X_{w}$ = $min(0, X_{w-1} - X_{w})$.</p><p>$\textbf{case 2}$: But if $i > X_{w-1}$, then by $\textbf{lemma (1)}$ each unit $u_{i, w}$ is contained in some $S_k$ which is per se an element of $S^{'}$, the sculpture set on board $b^{'}_{h \times w-1}$. Hence, Those units do not contribute new counts to $S$, the sculpture set on board $b_{h \times w}$ than counted in $S^{'}$. On the other hand, It is clear that $X_{w-1} \leq X_{w}$, So $X_{w-1} - X_{w} \leq 0$. So, $min(0, X_{w-1} - X_{w}) = 0$ which conforms with what we just proved that no new sculptures are added than those in board $b^{'}$.</p><p>From <strong>case 1</strong> and <strong>case 2</strong>, $min(0, X_{w-1} - X_{w})$ is equal to new sculptures not in sculpture set $S^{'}$ on board $b^{'}_{h \times w-1}$. Therefore, cardinality of set $S$ is equal to cardinality set $S^{'}$ plus $min(0, X_{w-1} - X_{w})$. via induction hypothesis, cardinality of $S^{'} = \Sigma_{i=0}^{w^{'}-1}min(0, X_i-X_{i+1})$. So, cardinality of $S = \Sigma_{i=0}^{w-2}min(0, X_i-X_{i+1}) + min(0, X_{w-1}-X_{w}) = \Sigma_{i=0}^{w-1}min(0, X_i-X_{i+1})$
