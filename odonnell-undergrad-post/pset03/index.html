We can easily reprove it using the diagonalization argument.\nEx. 2 Enumerate all the two choices of a node colored in (red or blue), or colored in yellow, on all nodes. Consider the two subgraphs separately; If the yellow subgraph contains any edge reject the instance. Check if the other subgraph is 2-colorable. Only if yes, accept as the whole graph as 3-colorable.\nThe complexity is justified, Since checking 2-colorable is polynomially solved, on each instance of all two choices, on all nodes.\nClearly, If the graph is 3-colorable, then the algorithm catches the instance corresponding to nodes correctly colored in yellow and others in either red or blue. On the other hand, If the algorithm found a solution, Then the graph is 3-colorable, As the solution can easily be constructed.\nEx. 3 Observe the cases of $x_i$ and $x_j$ of the binary relation $x_i \\leq x_j$.\n(1) Both are assigned by a given condition (2) One is assigned 0 and the other is equal or less (2) One is assigned 1 and the other is equal or greater (3) Both are not assigned (4) One is assigned 0 and the other is equal or greater (4) One is assigned 1 and the other is equal or less We give an algorithm that costs exactly one linear scan. Scan all binary relations $x_i \\leq x_j$, If\nof type (1), Check whether assigned values conform to the relation, and reject satisfiability if not. of type (2), Assign 0 and 1, Correspondingly, So that values conform to the relation. If a conflict is faced, where there’s a prior assignment, that precludes from assigning what satisfies the relation, reject. To see why the algorithm is correct, We construct a valid solution, Given what the algorithm had already verified. For case\n(3), assign $x_i = 0$ and $x_j$ arbitrarily $0$ or $1$ (4), assign arbitrarily $0$ or $1$ Clearly, cases $3$ and $4$, do not conflict with cases $1$ or $2$, Since the algorithm has already checked and assigned what satisfies cases $1$ and $2$. Case $3$ doesn’t conflict with $4$, As $4$ allows any assignment. Remaining $x_i$ with no conditions at all, can be arbitrarily assigned as well.\nEx. 4 From hw02-2-b, We are given a procedure haltMachine(T, f(n)) that produces a Turing Machine $T_{f(n)}$, which is exactly the same as machine $T$, but halts within $f(n)$ steps; If $T$ terminates within $f(n)$, Then $T_{f(n)}$ produces the same output; Otherwise rejects. Note $T_{f(n)}$ is multi-tab, whereby at each step simulated of $T$, a counter on a specific tab is increased by one.\na For any polynomial time machine $T$, We know it runs in time at most $kn^k$. $T_{kn^k}$ simulates $T$ upto $kn^k$ steps which suffices to ensure it produces the same output.\nb Since $T$ is polynomial, and at each step, counter increase is polynomial, The total resulting complexity is polynomial.\nc Observe to construct $T_{f(n)}$, We would need to integrate a sub-routine that increases counter by one, where every state points to it after completing its one-step operation. For every state $q_i$, we create a new state $q_{i-counter}$ such that\n$q_i$ transitions to $q_{i-counter}$, instead of $q_r$ as in $T$, exactly after one-step. $q_{i-counter}$ transitions to $q_r$, what $q_i$ transitions to in $T$, after completing all steps required for increasing counter by one. Clearly the transformation is linear in time.\nd Alice can basically check for the sub-routine that increases counter by one, and check for the state that terminates the machine, upon the counter reaching $f(n)$.\nThe algorithm of checking polynomiality is clear, if the reader is convinced by the procedure of transformation.\n",
