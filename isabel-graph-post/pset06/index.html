$(\rightarrow).$ Assume connected $G$ has an Eulerian trail. If $G$ has also an Eulerian circuit then we are done by theorem 3.5. Then we have trail $t = (v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k)$ where $t$ is not a circuit, i.e $v_1 \neq v_k$.
Since the graph is connected, We know all vertices do appear in $t$. For any interior vertex $u$ in $t$ we know it counts two edges by the definition of a trail and the prohibition of self-loops. It follows any vertex $u \neq v_1, v_k$ is of even degree, As its degree is 2 times the number of times it appears in $t$. Moreover $v_1$ counts an additional single edge since the trail starts with it, So its degree is odd. Similarly $v_k$ is of an odd degree."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://mostafatouny.github.io/isabel-graph-post/pset06/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.e6ee52f0fc7c2e3dbd78858fc1b3e06fb86a3c6ee38d351342e06e23a24d02d6.css integrity="sha256-5u5S8Px8Lj29eIWPwbPgb7hqPG7jjTUTQuBuI6JNAtY=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://mostafatouny.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://mostafatouny.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://mostafatouny.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://mostafatouny.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://mostafatouny.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://mostafatouny.github.io/isabel-graph-post/pset06/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="Homework 06"><meta property="og:description" content="Exercises
