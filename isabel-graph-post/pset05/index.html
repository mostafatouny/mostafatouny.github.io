It follows immediately from theorem 3.5, which states a graph $G$ of order $n$ is a tree iff it is connected and has exactly $n-1$ edges.\n(b). The condition is $G$ is itself a tree. It is sufficient as $G$ is a subgraph of itself. It is necessary as if we considered an arbitrary induced subgraph spanning tree $T$, Then by definition of spanning, $T$ contains all the vertices of $G$. So $T = G$ and $G$ is a tree.\n2 (a) Pick a vertex $v$ with maximal degree $k$. For each neighbour $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k$, We have paths: \\begin{aligned} (v, v_1) \\\\ (v, v_2) \\\\ \\dots (v, v_k) \\end{aligned} Since the graph is finite, By the well-ordering principle, There exists maximal paths $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k$ such that $p_i$ starts with $(v, v_i)$. It follows $p_i$ ends with a leaf $l_i$.\nSince the graph is a tree, The paths $p_i$ do not intersect except on $v$, lest forming a cycle. In other words, leaves $l_i$ are distinct, and hence the $k$ paths do count $k$ leaves.\n(b) We prove it by induction on the tree’s order, i.e number of vertices. For the base case, We have $|T| = 2$. Then $T$’s leaves count $L(T)$ is \\begin{aligned} 2 \u0026= 2 + \\sum_{v \\in V(T^-)} ( deg(v) - 2 ) \\\\ \u0026= 2 + 0 \\end{aligned} Since $T^-$ is empty.\nInduction hypothesis. Assume the statement is true for any $T$ such that $|T| \\geq 2$.\nInduction step. Consider a tree $T$ where $|T| = n+1$. Fix a leaf $l$ and its connected neighbour $f$ in $T$.\nObserve $f$ cannot be a leaf, As otherwise $T$ shall be of size $2$, Contradicting our assumption. So $f$ is a non-leaf vertex.\nConstruct tree $T' = T - l$. Then by the induction hypothesis \\begin{aligned} L(T’) \u0026= 2 + \\sum_{v \\in T’^-} (deg(v) - 2) \\end{aligned} Then \\begin{aligned} |L(T)| \u0026= |L(T’)| + 1 \\\\ \u0026= 2 + \\sum_{v \\in T’^-} (deg_{T’}(v) - 2) + 1 \\end{aligned} Observe \\begin{aligned} deg_T f \u0026= deg_{T’} f + 1 \\\\ deg_T u \u0026= deg_{T’} u \\quad \\text{For any non-leaf vertex u } \\neq f \\end{aligned} It follows \\begin{aligned} \\sum_{v \\in T^- - f} (deg_T v - 2) = \\sum_{v \\in T’^- - f} (deg_T’ v - 2) \\end{aligned} By $(3)$ and $(5)$, \\begin{aligned} \\sum_{v \\in T^-} (deg_T(v) - 2) \u0026= \\sum_{v \\in T^- - f} (deg_T(v) - 2) + (deg_T(f) - 2) \\\\ \u0026= \\sum_{v \\in T’^- - f} (deg_{T’} v - 2) + (deg_{T’}(f) - 2) + 1 \\\\ \u0026= \\sum_{v \\in T’^-} (deg_{T’} v - 2) + 1 \\end{aligned} Combining that last result with (2), We get \\begin{aligned} |L(T)| \u0026= 2 + \\left ( \\sum_{v \\in T^-} (deg_T(v) - 2) - 1 \\right ) + 1 \\\\ \u0026= 2 + \\sum_{v \\in T^-} (deg_T(v) - 2) \\quad \\blacksquare \\\\ \\end{aligned}\n3 Notation. We denote the total weight of a graph by $w(G)$, Which is the summation of all edges weights.\nWe show if there are two distinct minimum spanning trees $T_0$ and $T_1$, where $w(T_0) = w(T_1) = k$, then a contradiction occurs. Namely the existince of a spanning tree $T_2$ such that $w(T_2) \u003c k$.\nSince $T_0$ and $T_1$ are distinct, They do not agree on all edges. WLOG we can select the minimal-weight edge $e_{min} = \\{ v_1, v_2 \\}$ in $T_0$ not in $T_1$. Since $T_1$ is connected, We know there is a path $p_1 = (v_1, \\dots, v_2)$ in $T_1$. Fix an edge $e'$ from $p_1$. Construct $T_2 = T_1 - e' + e_{min}$.\nThe added $e_{min}$ does not construct a new cycle. If that were the case, Then $T_1$ would have had another path $p_2 = (v_1, \\dots, v_2)$, Concluding $T_1$ has a cycle by combining $p_1$ and $p_2$. In conclusion $T_2$ is acyclic, i.e a spanning tree.\nRecall $e_{min}$ was chosen to be the minimum weight edge. So $w(e_{min}) \u003c w(e')$ and in turn $w(T_2) \u003c w(T_1)$.\n4 $(\\rightarrow)$. Let $e$ be an arbitrary bridge. Let $T$ be an arbitrary spanning tree of $G$. Assume for contradiction $T$ does not contain $e$. By definition there are two vertices in $G$, $v_1$ and $v_2$, which are not connected in $G - e$. Since $E(T) \\subset E(G)$, It follows there is no path either connecting $v_1$ and $v_2$ in $T$. Contradiction as $T$ spans $G$.\n$(\\leftarrow)$. Let $e$ be an edge appearing in any spanning tree of $G$.\nConsider graph $G-e$, and fix $v_0$ in it. Consider the connected component $C_0$ of $G-e$ containing $v_0$. By definition $e \\notin C_0$. Let $T_0$ be the tree spanning $C_0$. By hypothesis $T_0$ does not span the graph $G$. Call the vertex not covered by it $v_1$.\nWe claim there is no path $(v_0, \\dots, v_1)$ in $G-e$ and hence concluding it is disconnected, and in turn $e$ is a bridge. Assume for contradiction we have the path $p_0 = (v_0, \\dots, v_1)$ in $G-e$, Then $p_0$ is in $C_0$, and in turn $v_1$ is connected to $v_0$ in $T_0$. Contradiction.\n","wordCount":"840","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-06-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-06-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mostafatouny.github.io/isabel-graph-post/pset05/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Mostafa Touny","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mostafatouny.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script><script id=MathJax-script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-chtml.js></script><script>MathJax={tex:{displayMath:[["$$","$$"],["\\[","\\]"]],inlineMath:[["$","$"],["\\(","\\)"]]}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mostafatouny.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Mostafa Touny (Alt + H)">Mostafa Touny</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://mostafatouny.github.io/about title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://mostafatouny.github.io/post title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Homework 05</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-06-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 1, 2024</span></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#exercises aria-label=Exercises>Exercises</a><ul><li><a href=#section aria-label=1>1</a></li><li><a href=#section-1 aria-label=2>2</a><ul><li><a href=#a aria-label=(a)>(a)</a></li><li><a href=#b aria-label=(b)>(b)</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#section-2 aria-label=3>3</a></li><li><a href=#section-3 aria-label=4>4</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h2 id=exercises class=unnumbered>Exercises<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#exercises>#</a></h2><h3 id=section class=unnumbered>1<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#section>#</a></h3><p><strong>(a).</strong> It follows immediately from <em>theorem 3.5</em>, which states a graph

For the base case, We have $|T| = 2$. Then $T$&rsquo;s leaves count $L(T)$ is
\begin{aligned}
2 &= 2 + \sum_{v \in V(T^-)} ( deg(v) - 2 ) \\

\begin{aligned}
L(T&rsquo;) &= 2 + \sum_{v \in T&rsquo;^-} (deg(v) - 2)
\end{aligned}
Then
\begin{aligned}
|L(T)| &= |L(T&rsquo;)| + 1 \\
&= 2 + \sum_{v \in T&rsquo;^-} (deg_{T&rsquo;}(v) - 2) + 1
\end{aligned}
Observe
\begin{aligned}
deg_T f &= deg_{T&rsquo;} f + 1 \\
deg_T u &= deg_{T&rsquo;} u \quad \text{For any non-leaf vertex u } \neq f
\end{aligned}
It follows
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{v \in T^- - f} (deg_T v - 2) = \sum_{v \in T&rsquo;^- - f} (deg_T&rsquo; v - 2)
\end{aligned}
By $(3)$ and $(5)$,
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{v \in T^-} (deg_T(v) - 2) &= \sum_{v \in T^- - f} (deg_T(v) - 2) + (deg_T(f) - 2) \\
&= \sum_{v \in T&rsquo;^- - f} (deg_{T&rsquo;} v - 2) + (deg_{T&rsquo;}(f) - 2) + 1 \\
&= \sum_{v \in T&rsquo;^-} (deg_{T&rsquo;} v - 2) + 1
