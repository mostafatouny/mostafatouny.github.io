## Playing The Video
[Here](https://shared02.opsone-cloud.ch/index.php/s/FmNiNmFyszneiTY). The record generated by zoom is corrupted beginning from 7:30, but luckly we catched a good part.



## In Brief

This is a very nice memory of my enrollment in [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/)'s [Math115AH](https://www.math.ucla.edu/ugrad/courses/math/115AH) honors linear algebra course, taught by prof. [Richard Elman](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~rse/). It all started with [TCS's subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/theoreticalcs) where I was very fortunate to meet a wonderful student, Kyle Hess. I was consulting his advices for a while. He even recommended me to prof. R. Elman's course, So that I get a chance of building up a community and meeting other math enthusiasts. Don't miss the video, It contains really very kind words by him.

## Quotes

**Kyle Hess**

> Over the years it became apparent to me that you, Mostafa, are very dedicated to learn mathematics and I found it tragic you have no resources like a community.

> It was clear to me how hard you are trying but you don't have the basic fundamentals, that you needed an extra support in a form of class.

> I was able to have these resources, so I wanted to share that with other people because is such a beautiful thing, and I am glad you were able to have this experience.



**Richard Elman**

> When we started this class I told you it would be a hard class. So, I did not fool you for sure. Mathematics is always difficult to learn and it takes alot of work.

> Learn things and follow what you like. Don't let anybody say you should do this for any reason. If you find something you like, Follow it.

## Personal Remarks and Retrospections

At the moment of writing these lines, Less than one week separates me from completing my 7th semester, out of a total of 8 semesters of my university's program. I have been so ambitious to achieve something big during the past years. The conclusion I arrive at now is: I lack undergrad foundational basics, Usually mastered by an average student. I feel really bad.



I will always be indebted to Kyle for alarming me by a great pitfall I had fallen into. Namely, Approaching inaccessible problems with no good foundational toolboxes.



If there is a big lesson that, I learned before, and keep continually learn, It would be:

*I will never be on the right pathway. At best scenarios I learn from mistakes to get nearer of doing things right, but I would never be right 100%. Being a skeptic and continually learning from mistakes is not a temporary phase of a young kid. It is a morale to be reserved for someone's whole life.*
