**Currently**
- Research Assistant at The American University in Cairo
  - Co-advised by both [Dr. Daoud Siniora](https://sites.google.com/view/daoudsiniora) and [Dr. Amr El-Mougy](https://www.aucegypt.edu/fac/amr-el-mougy).
  - Ethical Autonomous Vehicles with Provable Guarantees.
  - Combining Learning-driven Deep Reinforcement Learning with Proven Logical Model.

**Interests**
- Computational Social Choice, and broadly economics & computation theory.
- Provable algorithms on continuous structures.
- Learning-augmented algorithms.
- Trustworthy and Machine Learning Theory.

**Vision** 

The internet revolutionized humanity's connectivity, and AI revolutionized information flow, and yet rarely do we cooperate. Socialists have ambitions for [Collective Intelligence](https://cci.mit.edu), A paradigm of AI which enables coherent cooperation among the crowd, but it is not recognized in technical communities.

Theoretical research of optimization, fairness, and social-choice is active on combinatorial structures, but their applicability is limited. Practitioners train predictive models on crowds' data, but their pragmatic methods lack theoretical understanding.

I aspire to:
1) Study social choice on structures other than combinatorics, Probably on continuous data, Expanding novel ideas, techniques, and applications. I liked [Generative Social Choice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01291).

2) Extend learning-augmented algorithms on computational social choice and algorithmic game theory, Utilizing data to shed new lights on algorithmic fairness and economics. I liked [Learning-Augmented Mechanism Design: Leveraging Predictions for Facility Location](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01120).

Both of which, Emphasized on theoretical foundations and provably guaranteed frameworks using proof and logic techniques.


I will always be remembering [Oded and Avi's 1996 essay](https://theorydish.blog/2021/04/15/toc-a-personal-perspective-2021).

**Society & Community.** I am delighted to moderate [TCS's subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/theoreticalcs) and [TCS's awesome list](https://github.com/mostafatouny/awesome-theoretical-computer-science), Getting the chance to meet students from all over the world.
