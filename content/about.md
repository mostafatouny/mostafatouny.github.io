**Currently**
- Research Assistant at The American University in Cairo.
  - Co-advised by both [Dr. Daoud Siniora](https://sites.google.com/view/daoudsiniora) and [Dr. Amr El-Mougy](https://www.aucegypt.edu/fac/amr-el-mougy).
  - Modeling ethics for Autonomous vehicles with provable guarantees.

**General Interest**
- Algorithms & Complexity.
- Intersection between discrete and continuous math.
- Trustworthy machine learning.
- Functional programming between math discovery and computing practice.

With emphasis on theoretical foundations and provably guaranteed frameworks using proof and logic techniques.

**Particular Curiousity**
- The internet revolutionized humanity's connectivity, and AI revolutionized information flow, and yet rarely do we cooperate. Socialists have ambitions for [Collective Intelligence](https://cci.mit.edu), A paradigm of AI which enables coherent cooperation among the crowd, but no technical progress of practical relevance is witnessed. In the same way Shafi and Silvio's zero-knowledge proofs enabled a new kind of secure communication, collective intelligence could lead to a new kind of economic interaction. See [Generative Social Choice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01291).
- Combinatorics is rooted in algorithmic toolboxes, but in the data driven world, statistics, algebra, analysis and topology are the mathematical underpinnings. [Algorithms on continuous](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jrl/teaching/cse535au21/) inputs with provable guarantees and [Topological Combinatorics](https://www.irif.fr/wtc24) are independently investigated, and connections are not yet clear. [Spreer](https://sites.google.com/view/jonathan-spreer/research)'s works are ambitious. In the same way Donald Knuth showed the relevance of Discrete Math to Algorithms, The new algorithmic wave could be analysis and topology.
- AI safety and alignment became very critical after the unexpected advancement of machine learning. [Learning-augmented algorithms](https://algorithms-with-predictions.github.io/) aims to retain robustness when predictions are inaccurate; [Neuro-Symbolic](https://sites.google.com/view/nesy2024/home) aims to design a hybrid of data-driven and symbolic-proven components. Nonetheless, theory and logic are not catching up with the rapid progress of practitioners. Are there near-term intermediate approaches to bridge theory and practice?
- Functional programming is a language that enables correct coding by definition. It is closer to a logician than a computer scientist who is used to machinery in Turing machines. Attempts like [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) and [Terry Tao's project](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/09/25/a-pilot-project-in-universal-algebra-to-explore-new-ways-to-collaborate-and-use-machine-assistance/) explore how CS and LLM could contribute to mathematical discovery. People in [Starth](https://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk/) investigate math contributing to programming languages. Nowadays it is believed natural language is the future of computing, but what about formal languages?

**Philosophy.**

I enjoy abstract thinking and truth discovery using pencil and paper. A theory is supposed to be enlightening before it becomes concrete into an application. I want my code to be correct by definition rather than by testing. I care and envision humanity's future and economic growth by means of leadership. Science progress is a social endeavour, and hence it is natural for a mathematician to care about people, teaching, and communication. CS theory is supposed to be justified; Either conceptually as deep as mathematics or practically as relevant as computer science. I will always be remembering [Oded and Avi's 1996 essay](https://theorydish.blog/2021/04/15/toc-a-personal-perspective-2021).

**Community.**

I do moderate [TCS's awesome list](https://github.com/mostafatouny/awesome-theoretical-computer-science), Getting the chance to meet students from all over the world.
